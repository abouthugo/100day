# 100 Days of code challenge
 
 Yes! I decided to take on this challenge.

## Logs

### Day 1: Basic HTML 5 & CSS 

**Progress:** Did the small code challenges from freecodecamp.org on the basics of HTML 5 and CSS. Learned about CSS variables and tinkered with them a little. 

**Thoughts:** Going back to the basics is more time consuming than what I initially pictured. Finding the right color palette is a tough task, I think i spent a good 20 minutes along with finding a good font. Thanks to this I now totally dig the way the colors change seamlessly with CSS classes.

### Day 2: Applied Visual Design

**Progress:** Beat all the challenges for the applied visual design on free code camp and came up with a little extra feature of their heartbeat animation. Learned about CSS position and practiced keyframes.

**Thoughts:** I always wondered how some of the illustrations I've seen in codepen even began to exist! I mean, there are some pretty crazy designs that just blow my mind when I learn that they have been made with only css and html. Today I broke through that fear and frustration. I enjoyed hacking together the heart and the moon with just CSS, maybe in the future I will dive more into that not so much obscure world.
