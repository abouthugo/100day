# 100 Days of code challenge

Yes! I decided to take on this challenge. Hopefully by the end of it I will be a more mature coder :dragon_face:

## Logs

### Day 1: Basic HTML 5 & CSS

**Progress:** Did the small code challenges from freecodecamp.org on the basics of HTML 5 and CSS. Learned about CSS variables and tinkered with them a little.

**Thoughts:** Going back to the basics is more time consuming than what I initially pictured. Finding the right color palette is a tough task, I think i spent a good 20 minutes along with finding a good font. Thanks to this I now totally dig the way the colors change seamlessly with CSS classes.

### Day 2: Applied Visual Design

**Progress:** Beat all the challenges for the applied visual design on free code camp and came up with a little extra feature of their heartbeat animation. Learned about CSS position and practiced keyframes.

**Thoughts:** I always wondered how some of the illustrations I've seen in codepen even began to exist! I mean, there are some pretty crazy designs that just blow my mind when I learn that they have been made with only css and html. Today I broke through that fear and frustration. I enjoyed hacking together the heart and the moon with just CSS, maybe in the future I will dive more into that not so much obscure world.

### Day 3: Accessible web

**Progress:** I went over the accessibility challenges in free code camp and learned how to use the HTML 5 audio element (see code pen 1). I succesfully implemented the border from the middle effect using `relative` and `absolute` positioning and `::after` pseudo selector (see conde pen 2).

**Thoughts:** I'm really onto something here. I like the fact that I'm understanding positioning better and I'm becoming a better CSS coder. I really look forward to the next lesson on responsive design in which I hope to code my very own toggle menu button and navbar.

### Day 4: Rock, paper, scissors!

**Progress:** I didn't go over any material on this day. However, I got in touch with some folks from the slack channel of Socket.io and explained my struggles for my game. I decided not to wait around and hacked a way to do a user confirmation by using a sort of handshake method. User 1 sends a requests and listens for confirmation. User 2 gets to decide whether to reject or accept. When User 2 accepts a confirmation to User 1 is sent, and the timer in both ends starts. Both players get 5 seconds to select their card and then they send each other their responses which in turn gets computed with the logic and they get their results. I wish there was anyther way of simplying this process, but for now this will do :confused:.

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend as much time as I would have wanted to. The code doesn't look pretty at the moment but I hope that when I get all the functionalities working I can focus on refactoring and making things more efficient. Today was a kind of down and slow day for me. Hopefully tomorrow turns out better.

### Day 5: no real theme here...

**Progress:** I worked on the responsive design tutorials on free code camp and ended up making a pokeball illustration with css.

**Thoughts:** I need to dedicate more time to flex box and all this responsive design since most of it is a little foggy in my mind.

### Day 6: More CSS figures

**Progress:** Today I felt like taking some inpiration from dribbble and try to mimic some design. I decided it was time to try creating new shapes other than circles in css so I decided to do a coffee cup.

**Thoughts:** Every day gets harder to make some time for this challenge. I fear that once the break is over I won't be able to committ to it :worried:

### Day 7: Gatsby, React, CSS Modules, & Video

**Progress:** I've gotta say that today was both challenging and hihghly productive. I've been wanting to put a web page together to showcase my work but I always had difficulty finding the best tools that will allow me to use React and the hosting wouldn't cost me much. Thanks to Gatsby.js I'm able to create a fast static site on React, and thanks to Netlify I'm able to share it with the world with \$0 cost. I didn't finish the entire site, I'll keep adding more stuff incrementally here and there but I'm proud of how much I got done today. The site is still not responsive tho :cold_sweat:, that will be my next move.

**Thoughts:** The more I learn about Gatsby and all the buzz about serverless sites, the more I get curious about its capabilities and limitations. I'm thinking of coming up with more projects that use Gatsby and this new serverless infrastructure to see how it performs.

### Day 8: Adding responsiveness to my site

**Progress:** I added some media queries on the navigation bar and added a hamburger menu to the mobile version of my site.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as much done as I would've liked but dealing with media queries can sometimes be cumbersome, specially when using css modules. I hope to finish the responsiveness the next day I work on it.

### Day 9: Adding responsiveness to my site

**Progress:** Today was a very productive and information day. I added the final tweaks for my site to be responsive, what's missing now is the content that is going to make it special. Now that I got the foundations down, I hope the next stage won't be such a conundrum.

**Thoughts:** I failed many times trying to add a feature and by the time I realized that adding such feature beyond my scope, I had already wasted 3 hours trying to make it work with different methods. On the bright side, thanks to that I learned a bunch stuff on Gatsby, like how to pass state with links and I also learned how to add maps from mapbox.

### Day 10: Started android assignment for a quiz app

**Progress:** Got button selection and main views done, no scoring system in place.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm cheating by counting this as part of the challenge but honestly I spent quite a few hours coding so I said: why not?

### Day 11: Finished android assignment

**Progress:** I managed to hack away the multiple answers feature required for this assignment but I didn't get to save data on the phone. Will learn how to in the next assignment.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to become familiar with the android development architecture. I used to spend hours just to get a simple feature to work, now its more seamless and efforless (depending on the level of complexity for a given feature).

### Day 12: Refactoring my website's code

**Progress:** Merged some React components with their respective SCSS modules into styled components. Added some more components for the next generation of the game.

**Thoughts:** I'm really psyched about using styled components throughout my entire code base and experimenting with the ThemeProvider component. I really wasn't aware of the fact that you could use scss syntax in a styled component, that's an awesome feature and it totally sold me out.

[Link to work](https://github.com/p-hugo/web-portfolio)

### Day 13: Going full styled-components on my website codebase

**Progress:** I decided that styled componentes are the way to go for styling on my website codebase so I changed most of the components to styled ones. I left some navbar components as scss modules because the scss was quite long and I thought they should stay separated once they become quite long.

**Thoughts:** Its starting to get very difficult to keep up with the school's workload and this challenge! However, I am not ready to quit. I need this to become a better developer so I will keep pressing forward and taking short breaks here and there.

### Day 14: React-spring basics

**Progress:** I started digging into what react-spring is all about and did some minor spring effets for the "creative corner" section of my site.

**Thoughts:** I really want to learn how to animate svg elements with this library but I don't know enough of svg to be able to understand the examples I've seen online.

### Day 15: AJAX Requests

**Progress:** I went back to a udemy course I had purchased last year and went over the ajax requests section to pull random quotes and random images from an API. I used the jQuery library to make the requests less verbose and easy on my end.

**Thoughts:** Touching base with the good old jQuery was refreshing considering the fact that I haven't really used the library ever since I started learning react 8 months ago.

[See the work](/day15/)

### Day 16: Fetch vs Axios vs jQuery AJAX vs XMLHttpRequest

**Progress:** Fetching data can be done in a variety of ways, too many for me to remembet honestly. This is the reason why I decided to refresh on some of the options I have and compare them in one simple page. For this day I used fetch, axios, jQuery Ajax and XMLHttpRequest to send a get request to a random design quote API. Then, once the data had been fetch the quotes is updated.

**Thoughts:** Today's lesson was very useful even though it felt really lightweight. I think that whenever I have my doubts about fetching some data from an API I will find myself looking back at the examples I coded for today.

[See the work](/day16/)

### Day 17: APIs

**Progress:** I started an API for questions. The main purpose is to store questions and answers for an interactive presentation. I want to display the participants answers real time after they are done answernig the questions in the middle of the presentation. I managed to set up 2 express routes with connections to an MLab database. I still need to add a way to post answers to the database.

**Thoughts:** Its been a little while since I've done backend stuff and I've gotta say that node js makes is very simple and easy. I saw a video from Wes Bos not too long ago where he used es6 syntax in his nodejs script and I decided to find the video and copy how he did the set up (which is very minimal). I ABSOLUTELY love how es6 syntax looks on node!

### Day 18: All about deployment

**Progress:** Today I decided it was time to start playing around with GCP. I went back to a very brief tutorial I've followed in the past that showed how to use docker with an express API. I did exactly that and managed to deploy it, it took me about 2 hours to figure it out but their guides are highly useful and friendly so it was definitely because of my level of understanding on Kubernetes. However, I did not end up using the deployed docker instance since google didn't provide me with https connections right off the bat I had to turn to Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as much work as I had hoped. In fact I didn't finish the presentation, I just didn't have enough time to do what I wanted and I didn't want to present something halfway done so I ended up not developing it further. I plan to automate this process for later use because I think it is very useful.

### Day 19: Docker Containers

**Progress:** I spent a good amount of time learning more about containers and a little bit about Kubernetes. I started a new course on docker in pluralsight and got the basics down. Since I'm running the commands on the terminal I don't think it'd be of any use adding that code in a repo so instead I added some more notes in my note-space repo where I post all my notes on technologies I'm currently learning.

**Thoughts:** Containers are cool. It seemed like such a daunting topic not so long ago but just diving right into them and poking around really helps me understand the full picture. I am by no means close to understanding the full depth of complexity and the power of what Docker can do but I am grasping the concepts and enjoying it. Can't wait to master this new technology and come up with new exciting projects!

### Day 20: Configuring own webpack settings for a React app

**Progress:** I followed a small tutorial on how to set up your very own webpack config for a React app. No fancy stuff just your regular ES6 to ES5 transpiling and an html loader. Might add hot realoding later.

**Thoughts:** Prior to this tutorial I had followed some instructions from a book published around 2015 and the information was obviously outdated. Back then I was really frustrated at how webpack worked because of the outcome from following the book's instructions. Now, is a joy looking at how easy it is to get started.

[See the config!](day20/)

### Day 21: Arduino and C++!?

**Progress:** Today I dived back into the arduino world. I created a small program and hooked up my arduino board to display my name of a LCD screen. By far the coolest hardware mini project I've done.

**Thoughts:** Where to begin?! Thanks to an extension called PlatformIO in VSCode I learned that the arduino programs are written in C++ so all the programs I've written for my arduino in the past were all written in C++ without me realizing it! I was dumbstruck by this epiphany. Through this mini project I realized how much I like working with hardware, I feel right at home and the code feels like its on another level since you are seeing physical objects being affected by the code you write. Which is AWESOME! I plan to do some IoT stuff in the future once I master this crazy art of tinkering with components and boards.

[See the code](day21/)

### Day 22: Typescript Basics

**Progress:** The day for me to play with Typescript has finally arrived! I went over 2-3 modules on plural sight about Typescript and took what I learned from there and implemented my own two scripts and compiled them down to JS manually.

**Thoughs:** I like what Typescript offers, however I feel like I am not at the level in which all the type checking makes a massivee difference in my workflow. I wonder how a React app would look with all the extra syntax, I'm used to using propTypes to handle the majority of errors and bugs related to type checking. So... I don't really see the benefit of adding yet another layer of abstraction. Maybe as I learn more and use it more I will find that out for myself.

### Day 23: Redesigning Web Portfolio

**Progress:** Oh boy did I put in some hours here! I basically deleted 1 sectiong of my website and changed a creative section to be more of a project section. I made these changes based on other web portfolios that I've seen around and that I really really like. I also tried using devicons with gatsby but failed to do so.

**Thoughts:** Some things will not always come out the way you want them and some features, sadly, will take more time that you had initially intended to invest. I learned this when I had to import all the icons for a "things I used" section in my website manually! I tried using the CDN from devicons but I couldn't figure out a fast way. I also tried using react-devicon but I kept getting more errors—which I think are gatsby related but didn't really want to invest the time in digging the issue, just wanted to make sure my feature could be implemented today. SO! I had to do it manually and at last it worked. Will probably revisit this in the future to see if any better implementations have been discovered.

### Day 24: Redesigning Navigation

**Progress:** Completely remade the navigation bar. Used Sketch to prototype and design it and then I tried implementing it with html and css.

**Thoughts:** Inspired by app designs I've seen in dribbble, I decided to give my unpublished website a fresh new look. CSS grid made it possible and a lot simpler than I thought. Next step will be to convert this html and css into react code that GatsbyJS can render and package together.

[See the work](day24/)

### Day 25: Restructuring Chat Room App

**Progress:** I went back in time and revisited my chat room app and made some major changes. First the file structure was thought out really bad, I was just learning how React and Node worked back then. I divided the src code for the react app in its own src folder and the backend server for socket connections also got its own directory. I also started using more es6 syntax in node through the use of esm so I converted frome es5 to es6 in the backend.

**Thoughts:** The feeling of looking back at old code and finding out how naive I was and how I am able to spot the mistakes I made in the past is amazing! Through it I can see how much I've grown, it reinforces the fact that all this time coding has not been a waste. I actually know what I'm doing now. I think I will be reopening half-finished projects from the past and giving them a fresh new life with the knowledge I now have.

### Day 26: Async Await, Promises, and much more

**Progress:** I worked on learning how async await works and implemented it at a project for one of my jobs.

**Thoughts:** I'm still pretty fresh when it comes to async await. It wasn't until recently that I started seeing it more in codebases that I follow, then I realized how convenient and efficient it can be.

### Day 27: Using Theme context in styled-components

**Progress**: Went over the documentation for the theme api in styled-components and implemented it in my own way.

**Thoughts** For some reason, I think the new styled-component library has broken my vscode. It takes forever to load and in some cases it doesn't even load. I need to find out what's wrong with this because its killing my workflow. Besides that, the theme context api is pretty straightforward I like it.

### Day 28: Tried to implement drag and drop with pure react

**Progress**: Not much. It was a frustrating day. I ended up trying to implement the library `react-beautiful-dnd` to do it but I ran out of time and left it half way done.

**Thoughts** Today felt like a total defeat. My vscode for some reasons is not working at all. Whenever I import the `styled-components` library into my project, the whole thing stops working!! I even had to uninstall vscode several times but with no luck.

[day27](https://github.com/p-hugo/todo)


### Day 29: Implemented Drag and Drop 

**Progress**: Implemented a simple drag and drop component with the help of `react-beautiful-dnd`. 

**Thoughts** The implementation still has some bugs but I will take some time to go over them later. Right now, my priority is to fix my problems with VS Code...

### Day 30: Refactored codebase in todo app

**Progress**: Worked on updating the syntax of the backend API to comply with es6. I used `esm` to help me run imports/exports part of the code since node hasn't catch up to this feature yet. 

**Thoughts**: Is the second time I refactor an entire codebase that I've created in the past. It feels good to know that the stuff I have been learning are being put to good use when I do these major refactoring and restructuring tasks.

[See the code](https://github.com/p-hugo/todo)

### Day 31: Flexbox, custom selector and more

**Progress**: I mostly worked on a website's flexbox model. Did some CSS icon creation and even a custom React selector. 

**Thoughs**: We take the small things for granted. The little icon hanging next to a link. The way a selector looks different from a regular one. All these things are really complex in their own way. After implementing my own selector, I notice these little things more and stop to admire the work developers have put into it.
