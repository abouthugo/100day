# 100 Days of code challenge

Yes! I decided to take on this challenge. Hopefully by the end of it I will be a more mature coder :dragon_face:

## Logs

### Day 1: Basic HTML 5 & CSS

**Progress:** Did the small code challenges from freecodecamp.org on the basics of HTML 5 and CSS. Learned about CSS variables and tinkered with them a little.

**Thoughts:** Going back to the basics is more time consuming than what I initially pictured. Finding the right color palette is a tough task, I think i spent a good 20 minutes along with finding a good font. Thanks to this I now totally dig the way the colors change seamlessly with CSS classes.

### Day 2: Applied Visual Design

**Progress:** Beat all the challenges for the applied visual design on free code camp and came up with a little extra feature of their heartbeat animation. Learned about CSS position and practiced keyframes.

**Thoughts:** I always wondered how some of the illustrations I've seen in codepen even began to exist! I mean, there are some pretty crazy designs that just blow my mind when I learn that they have been made with only css and html. Today I broke through that fear and frustration. I enjoyed hacking together the heart and the moon with just CSS, maybe in the future I will dive more into that not so much obscure world.

### Day 3: Accessible web

**Progress:** I went over the accessibility challenges in free code camp and learned how to use the HTML 5 audio element (see code pen 1). I succesfully implemented the border from the middle effect using `relative` and `absolute` positioning and `::after` pseudo selector (see conde pen 2).

**Thoughts:** I'm really onto something here. I like the fact that I'm understanding positioning better and I'm becoming a better CSS coder. I really look forward to the next lesson on responsive design in which I hope to code my very own toggle menu button and navbar.

### Day 4: Rock, paper, scissors!

**Progress:** I didn't go over any material on this day. However, I got in touch with some folks from the slack channel of Socket.io and explained my struggles for my game. I decided not to wait around and hacked a way to do a user confirmation by using a sort of handshake method. User 1 sends a requests and listens for confirmation. User 2 gets to decide whether to reject or accept. When User 2 accepts a confirmation to User 1 is sent, and the timer in both ends starts. Both players get 5 seconds to select their card and then they send each other their responses which in turn gets computed with the logic and they get their results. I wish there was anyther way of simplying this process, but for now this will do :confused:.

**Thoughts:** I didn't spend as much time as I would have wanted to. The code doesn't look pretty at the moment but I hope that when I get all the functionalities working I can focus on refactoring and making things more efficient. Today was a kind of down and slow day for me. Hopefully tomorrow turns out better.

### Day 5: no real theme here...

**Progress:** I worked on the responsive design tutorials on free code camp and ended up making a pokeball illustration with css.

**Thoughts:** I need to dedicate more time to flex box and all this responsive design since most of it is a little foggy in my mind.

### Day 6: More CSS figures

**Progress:** Today I felt like taking some inpiration from dribbble and try to mimic some design. I decided it was time to try creating new shapes other than circles in css so I decided to do a coffee cup.

**Thoughts:** Every day gets harder to make some time for this challenge. I fear that once the break is over I won't be able to committ to it :worried:

### Day 7: Gatsby, React, CSS Modules, & Video

**Progress:** I've gotta say that today was both challenging and hihghly productive. I've been wanting to put a web page together to showcase my work but I always had difficulty finding the best tools that will allow me to use React and the hosting wouldn't cost me much. Thanks to Gatsby.js I'm able to create a fast static site on React, and thanks to Netlify I'm able to share it with the world with \$0 cost. I didn't finish the entire site, I'll keep adding more stuff incrementally here and there but I'm proud of how much I got done today. The site is still not responsive tho :cold_sweat:, that will be my next move.

**Thoughts:** The more I learn about Gatsby and all the buzz about serverless sites, the more I get curious about its capabilities and limitations. I'm thinking of coming up with more projects that use Gatsby and this new serverless infrastructure to see how it performs.

### Day 8: Adding responsiveness to my site

**Progress:** I added some media queries on the navigation bar and added a hamburger menu to the mobile version of my site.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as much done as I would've liked but dealing with media queries can sometimes be cumbersome, specially when using css modules. I hope to finish the responsiveness the next day I work on it.
