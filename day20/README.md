# A custom webpack config mini project

First install the dependencies **`npm install`**

To build the bundle:

#### `yarn build` 

or 

#### `npm run build`

Then you can use something like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to spin up a little server and see the files on your machine.

:point_right: I have also added a `start` script in the `package.json` file to make this easy. Simply run **`npm run start`**
